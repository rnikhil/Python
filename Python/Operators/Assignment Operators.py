Assignment Operators:
=====================
Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.
There are various compound operators in Python like a += 5 that adds to the variable and later assigns the same.
It is equivalent to a = a + 5.

ex:
Operator	Example	         Equivatent to
=	        x = 5	           x = 5
+=	        x += 5	           x = x + 5
-=	        x -= 5	           x = x - 5
*=	        x *= 5	           x = x * 5
/=	        x /= 5	           x = x / 5
%=	        x %= 5	           x = x % 5
//=	        x //= 5	           x = x // 5
**=	        x **= 5	           x = x ** 5
&=	        x &= 5	           x = x & 5
|=	        x |= 5	           x = x | 5
^=	        x ^= 5	           x = x ^ 5
>>=	        x >>= 5	           x = x >> 5
<<=	        x <<= 5	           x = x << 5
