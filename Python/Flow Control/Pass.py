pass statement:
===============
In Python programming, pass is a null statement. The difference between a comment and pass statement in Python is that,
while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.
Syntax:
=======
pass

Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future.
so we use pass statement
ex:
sequence = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'}
for val in sequence:
    pass
 we can do the same thing in an empty function or class as well.
 ex:
 def function(args):
    pass

class example:
    pass
