Recursion:
===========
recursive function is a function that calls itself.
A function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself.
These type of construct are termed as recursive functions.

Advantages of Recursion:
========================
1. Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
2. A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
3. Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

Disadvantages of Recursion:
============================
1. Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
2. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
3. Recursive functions are hard to debug.

ex:
example of recursive function to find the factorial of an integer.
the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.
